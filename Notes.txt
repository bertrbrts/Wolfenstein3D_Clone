BIG TOPICS:
-Rendering Engine
-physics engine

-some way to insert game into engine.
-better scratchpad support
-better textures (reading, blitting, better image processing)
-some way to separate game and engine data
-Add higher level render constructs (shaders, materials, meshes, and textures)
-add some form of automatic shader selection
-add some form of primatives (rectangles, circles, triangles)
-more flexible transform class (default values for projection and camera)
-non-perspective views (orthogonal views)
-Texture manipulation (translation, rotation, scale)
-More control over textures (filtering, formatting)
-More friendly constructors
-Window should have more properties (Center position, full screen)
-better vector math (normalization, +=, commonly used vector constants, swizzling)
-options system 
-centralized level or scene class that holds the data the game is using
-Game Object class
- make all positioning names "position"
- make naming more consistant
-vector swizzle
- transparency support
- easier mesh generation
-sprite support
- good way to compare vectors
- Vector2f cross product
- display text
